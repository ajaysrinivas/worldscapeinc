                    <p>"WorldScape Inc. is vey reliable, professional and efficient. After working in a full time position for many years, I was hesitant to work with a consulting firm. WorldScape Inc., however, was different from other consulting firms. I am very happy that I decided to work with Dew. They have very good client relationship that provide them numerous openings. One of the things I like about them is that the payments are made in timely manner as agreed on the contract. I would recommend WorldScape Inc. to any one looking for contract opportunities.
                    Shashank worked with me through the entire process, from understanding what I was looking for to the time I started working at the client site. He is very energetic and quickly provides required information. When I had too many offers to choose from, Suresh helped me make the right decision. Many thanks to Shashank and Suresh. I have always been very impressed with the quality of service I have received from Dew. Thank you team Dew! You have always been helpful and obliging. Also you found me the exact job that I wanted."</p>
